# IFC Processor

The IFC Processor is Castor's foundation layer. It ingests IFC files, validates them, extracts structured entity data, and generates semantic descriptions that feed the RAG pipeline and write-back system.

## Supported Schemas

- **IFC2x3** — most common in practice, widely exported by Revit, ArchiCAD, etc.
- **IFC4** — newer standard with richer property definitions

The processor targets standard schemas, not vendor-specific extensions, to maximise interoperability.

## Validation

IFC files go through two validation checks before parsing:

1. **Extension check** — file must have `.ifc` extension
2. **Content check** — file must contain a valid STEP header (`ISO-10303-21`), preventing renamed non-IFC files from entering the system

Additionally, duplicate detection compares file hashes to prevent re-uploading identical files to the same project.

## Parsing Pipeline
```
Upload → Validate (extension + STEP header) → Parse (IfcOpenShell)
       → Extract Spatial Hierarchy
       → Extract Entities + Properties
       → Generate Semantic Descriptions
       → Store in Database
```

### Spatial Hierarchy Extraction

The parser traverses the IFC spatial structure:
```
IfcProject
  └── IfcSite
        └── IfcBuilding
              ├── IfcBuildingStorey (Level 0)
              │     ├── IfcWall, IfcDoor, IfcWindow, ...
              │     └── IfcSpace
              ├── IfcBuildingStorey (Level 1)
              │     └── ...
              └── ...
```

Each entity is tagged with its containing storey, enabling floor-level filtering in queries and modifications.

### Entity Extraction

For each building element, the processor extracts:

| Field | Source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `global_id` | `entity.GlobalId` | `"2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FNr2"` |
| `ifc_type` | `entity.is_a()` | `"IfcWallStandardCase"` |
| `name` | `entity.Name` | `"W-01"` |
| `description` | `entity.Description` | `"External wall"` |
| `object_type` | `entity.ObjectType` | `"Basic Wall:Generic - 200mm"` |
| `tag` | `entity.Tag` | `"W-01"` |
| `building_storey` | Spatial containment lookup | `"Level 1"` |
| `properties` | All PropertySets as JSON | `{"Pset_WallCommon": {"IsExternal": true, ...}}` |

### Property Extraction

Properties are extracted from all PropertySets (`IfcPropertySet`) associated with each entity via `IfcRelDefinesByProperties`. The result is a nested JSON structure:
```json
{
  "Pset_WallCommon": {
    "IsExternal": true,
    "IsLoadBearing": false,
    "FireRating": "EI60",
    "ThermalTransmittance": 0.25
  },
  "Pset_QuantityTakeOff": {
    "Reference": "Basic Wall:Generic - 200mm"
  }
}
```

This JSON is stored in the `IFCEntity.properties` JSONField, making it queryable from Django ORM and accessible to the write-back validator without re-opening the IFC file.

## Semantic Description Generation

After extraction, each entity gets a human-readable description optimised for embedding similarity. This is the text that enters the RAG vector space.

**Template pattern:**
```
{ifc_type} "{name}" on {storey}.
Type: {object_type}.
Properties: {key properties as natural language}.
```

**Example output:**
```
IfcWallStandardCase "W-01" on Level 1.
Type: Basic Wall:Generic - 200mm.
External wall. Load-bearing: no. Fire rating: EI60.
Thermal transmittance: 0.25 W/m²K.
```

The description intentionally uses natural language rather than raw JSON so that user queries like "fire-rated walls on the ground floor" have high semantic similarity to the stored descriptions.

## Data Model

### IFCFile

Represents an uploaded IFC file within a project.

- Links to a `Project` (environment)
- Tracks processing status: `pending` → `processing` → `completed` / `failed`
- Stores file hash for duplicate detection
- Records entity count after successful parsing

### IFCEntity

Represents a single extracted building element.

- Links to its parent `IFCFile`
- `global_id` — the IFC GlobalId, unique within the file
- `ifc_type` — entity class (IfcWall, IfcDoor, etc.)
- `name`, `description`, `object_type`, `tag` — direct IFC attributes
- `building_storey` — resolved spatial container
- `properties` — JSONField with all PropertySet data
- `embedding` — VectorField (1024d) for RAG similarity search

## What Gets Stored vs. What Stays in the File

| Data | Stored in DB | Stays in IFC file |
|---|---|---|
| Entity attributes (name, type, GlobalId) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Properties (all PropertySets) | ✅ (JSON) | ✅ |
| Spatial hierarchy (storey assignment) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Semantic description | ✅ | — |
| Embedding vector | ✅ | — |
| Geometry | — | ✅ |
| Material associations | — (future) | ✅ |
| Relationships (aggregates, connections) | — (future) | ✅ |

The DB acts as a queryable index. The IFC file remains the source of truth. Write-back operations modify the IFC file directly (via IfcOpenShell), then the DB is re-synced.

## Management Commands
```bash
# Parse all uploaded IFC files with "pending" status
uv run manage.py parse_ifc --all-pending

# Parse a specific file by ID
uv run manage.py parse_ifc --file-id <uuid>
```

## Design Decisions

1. **IfcOpenShell for both read and write** — single library for the full lifecycle, avoiding translation between tools.
2. **Flat property JSON** — properties stored as a single JSONField rather than normalised tables. Simpler to query, display, and pass to the LLM as context. Trade-off: no relational queries on individual properties (mitigated by `property_match` filter in write-back).
3. **Semantic descriptions over raw data** — embedding natural language descriptions rather than structured JSON dramatically improves retrieval quality for natural language queries.
4. **Storey as a string field** — stored as the storey name (e.g. "Level 1") rather than a FK. Simpler, and IFC storey names are stable within a file. Enables case-insensitive contains filtering.
